## Short-term effects of logging on oak dependent longhorn beetles
This project evaluates the effects of forestry actions on six cerambycid species. Pheromone based trapping were conducted during three years following forestry actions at 16 oak forests. By comparing the beetle abundance to that in control sites, the colonization and hatching phases following dead wood substrate boosts are analyzed.

## Longhorn beetle abundance in protected and oak production habitats
The abundance of six longhorn beetle species is evaluated in 52 oak dominated forest stands. Local habitat effects are analyzed by comparing formally protected woodlands, key biotopes and entomological hotspots, to different types of oak production forests.

## Spatial effects of oak volume on saproxylic beetle abundance 
The project analyses distribution and volumes of oak forests to identify critical spatial scales for the presence and abundance of saproxylic moths and cerambycid beetles. By combining beetle abundance data from several large scale pheromone based studies, important landscape characters and treshold levels are determined.

## *Tragosoma depsarium* distribution and landscape requirements in Southern Sweden
The project aim to map the distribution of the redlisted longhorn beetle *Tragosoma depsarium* in southeastern Sweden. Through spatial analyses treshold levels of *Pinus sylvestris* and other landscape characters are determined.

## Habitat utilization of *Tragosoma depsarium* in Swedish production forests
The project investigates local habitat requirements of *Tragsosoma depsarium*. Utilizing a mark-recapture methodology, occupancy and dispersal characteristics of the species are evaluated.

## Chemical ecology of rare and threatened beetles
The project aim to improve capabilities of monitoring saproxylic insects. Utilizing GCMS and EAG techniques, sex pheromones of species ecological interest are identified. Pheromone lures are synthetized to be used for effective and systematic bioassays indicator species.
