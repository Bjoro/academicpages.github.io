# Spatial and temporal substrate effects on oak dependent insects 
## Short-term effects of logging on saproxylic longhorn beetles
Saproxylic longhorn beetles include a large number of threatened species, as well as indicator and flagship species for forest conservation. However, many species are problematic to study quantitatively with traditional methods, as they are dependent on ephemeral substrates such as fresh, recently dead wood.

Using a pheromone-based trapping procedure, we conducted a two-year study measuring abundance of seven beetle species at 52 oak dominated forest stands and woodlands in Sweden. The sites were categorized into treatment stands which had undergone recent logging activity, controls without recent logging, protected key biotopes and old oak hotspots.

In general, treatment stands had a higher average number of beetles compared to the controls, but the effect strength varied between the years. Surprisingly, key biotopes and hotspots did not perform better than the controls and had fewer beetles than the treatments. We conclude that logging activities in oak forests can benefit many species of longhorn beetles, provided that some of the wood material is left on site, but ecologically demanding species, e.g. Poecilium pusillum and Plagionotus detritus, will require more specific conservation actions.

In addition, pheromone-based monitoring appears to be a promising tool to study this group of elusive insects under field conditions.

# *Tragosoma depsarium* in Sweden 
## Landscape effects in Southern Sweden
Changes in forest management regimes have during the last centuries turned Swedish forests increasingly more homogeneous, mostly dominated by dense and young spruce stands. This has led to the disappearance of many previously common habitats with complex effects on biodiversity. Insects, which as a group constitutes a large proportion of forest biodiversity have often been underrepresented in habitat surveys, often due to difficult and expensive survey methods. During recent years pheromone based survey methods has started to ameliorate these problems by allowing for large scale studies of threatened insects.

Tragosoma depsarium is a saproxylic beetle spending its larval stage inside logs of old Pinus sylvestris trees. The species was previously common in large parts of Sweden but has declined during the last century and is today considered Near Threatened on the Swedish Red List. Although a large characteristic beetle, not much is known about its habitat requirements and dispersal capacity. To investigate this a study of T. depsarium occurrence was performed on a regional scale with 162 investigated potential habitats in the Swedish counties of Kalmar and Östergötland. A mark and recapture study was simultaneously conducted in a hotspot area in Kalmar county.

By combining, at the sites locally measured, habitat characteristics and satellite based forest volume GIS data, models explaining species presence were created. The most important explanatory variables seemed to be the volume of P. sylvestris in a three km radius, the density of trees around the traps and the number of logs within 100 m of the traps. The mark and recapture study showed movements of up to almost 4 km and indicated large beneficial effects of targeted conservation efforts on the population abundance of T. depsarium.

## *Anaglyptus mysticus* and *Xylotrechus antilope*
We studied the pheromone chemistry of the cerambycids Anaglyptus mysticus and Xylotrechus antilope ssp. antilope with the goal of identifying attractants that could be used as tools for pheromone-based monitoring of these two species, which are rare and red-listed in parts of northern Europe. Beetles were reared from naturally colonized branches of hazel (Corylus avellana) or oak (Quercus robur), respectively, and used for headspace sampling. The extracts of volatiles were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Males of A. mysticus consistently produced large quantities of (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone and 2-nonanone, minor amounts of 2,3-hexanedione, and trace amounts of six other compounds. The average proportion of 2-nonanone to (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone was 70:100. Males of X. antilope produced large quantities of (S)-2-hydroxy-3-octanone, and minor quantities of 2,3-octanedione. None of these compounds were present in the corresponding extracts of females from either species. The attractiveness of the dominant compounds produced by each species was determined in field bioassays. Lures with racemic 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone and 2-nonanone as single compounds were not attractive to A. mysticus. However, the compounds acted synergistically in blends of 100:100 and 160:100 of 2-nonanone to the hydroxyketone’s (R)-enantiomer, but not in a 40:100 blend. Similarly (S)-2-hydroxy-3-octanone and its racemate attracted significantly more X. antilope than controls. Males and females of both species were captured in approximately equal numbers. The aggregation-sex pheromones of A. mysticus and X.antilope have high potential to serve as sensitive and efficient tools for detection and monitoring of local populations, and in studies of the species’ ecology and conservation requirements.
