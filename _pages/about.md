I am a PhD student working within the chemical ecology group at SLU, Alnarp. My work is focused on identifying and utilizing insect pheromones (sexual attractant chemicals) for the conservation of rare and threatened insects. My research is mostly focused on dead wood dependent species tied to the Swedish forest landscape, and how they react to modern forestry. While an increasing number of efforts have been taken to increase the amount of dead wood in Swedish forests, the effects on biodiversity is still largely unknown. This is to a large part due to the difficulty in conducting systematic surveys and evaluations of insect population dynamics, both on habitat and landscape levels. 

Within my projects I work on developing new effective methods of large scale monitoring of cryptic species. Using the species own attractants it possible to set up systematic large scale monitoring schemes to observe changes in the distribution and abundance of specific insect species. This allows me to study the relationship between saproxylic species abundance and the resource availability of the surrounding landscape at different spatial and temporal scales.
