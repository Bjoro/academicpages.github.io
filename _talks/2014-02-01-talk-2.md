Saproxylic longhorn beetles include a large number of threatened species, as well
as indicator and flagship species for forest conservation. However, many species
are problematic to study quantitatively with traditional methods, as they are
dependent on ephemeral substrates such as fresh, recently dead wood. Using a
pheromone-based trapping procedure, we conducted a two-year study measuring
abundance of seven beetle species at 52 oak dominated forest stands and
woodlands in Sweden. The sites were categorized into treatment stands which
had undergone recent logging activity, controls without recent logging, protected
key biotopes and old oak hotspots. In general, treatment stands had a higher
average number of beetles compared to the controls, but the effect strength
varied between the years. Surprisingly, key biotopes and hotspots did not
perform better than the controls and had fewer beetles than the treatments. We
conclude that logging activities in oak forests can benefit many species of
longhorn beetles, provided that some of the wood material is left on site, but
ecologically demanding species, e.g. Poecilium pusillum and Plagionotus detritus,
will require more specific conservation actions. In addition, pheromone-based
monitoring appears to be a promising tool to study this group of elusive insects
