Forestry is ever more important for the societal framework of long-term sustainability and climate change. From this
perspective, high productivity and exploitation of forest resources is very desirable. This could easily lead to increased
losses of biodiversity, however, unless steps are taken to monitor biodiversity changes and resolve these potential
conflicts. The primary focus of our project is the consequences of forestry regimes on the biodiversity of saproxylic and
other forest related insects. Insects constitute a large and very diverse group with many potential indicators of the effects
of forestry on biodiversity and the ecological state of food webs. We develop and apply new models for monitoring of
strategic insect species by means of pheromones (sexual attractant chemicals), whose legendary attractiveness provides an
uncomplicated and highly efficient method for real-time population monitoring of rare or inconspicuous species. Our project
will provide a toolbox for monitoring of a standard set of indicator species, to characterize biodiversity effects of forestry
regimes, and promote actions taken to support biodiversity. We will characterize general effects on insect biodiversity at
the stand and landscape levels. The aim is to integrate monitoring with different management models, to enable the highest
possible production goals within any given framework set by preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
